# Codatta Frontier Standards

Welcome to the **Codatta Frontier Standards** repository! This repository is designed to host standards and schemas for multiple frontiers, providing a foundation for consistent, high-quality data labeling across diverse domains. Codatta’s goal is to facilitate **crowd annotation** and **data curation** efforts that support AI and industry applications through a collaborative and standardized approach.

## 🌐 About Codatta

This repository is part of the Codatta ecosystem, a platform dedicated to connecting **AI developers** with **data creators** to collaboratively train advanced AI. Codatta’s mission is to leverage **collaborative training**, **human-driven labeling**, and **quality assurance mechanisms** to co-train AI models toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Learn more about our mission and other projects at [codatta.io](https://codatta.io).

For questions or to reach out to the maintainers, contact us at **[dev-opensource@codatta.io](mailto:dev-opensource@codatta.io)**.

## 📂 Repository Structure (Example)

Each frontier directory includes:
- **taxonomy-and-schema.md**: Documentation outlining the taxonomy and schema, providing a structured format for annotations.
- **schema_vX.json**: JSON files that define the schema for data annotation.
- **guidelines.md**: Task-specific guidelines for contributors working within each frontier.

For example:
```
codatta-frontier-standards/ 
├── frontier-<name-of-frontier>/ 
│   ├── taxonomy-and-schema.md 
│   ├── schema_v1.json 
│   └── guidelines.md
```


This structure serves as a guideline for adding new frontiers, ensuring consistency across different domains.

## 🗂 Current Frontiers
The following frontiers have been added to the repository:
- **Crypto Account Annotation**

As new frontiers are introduced, they will be added to this list, expanding Codatta's collaborative annotation ecosystem.

## ➕ Adding a New Frontier
To expand this repository and introduce a new frontier:
1. **Create a new directory** named `frontier-<new-frontier-name>` following the existing structure.
2. **Add a brief entry in the "Current Frontiers" section** of this README to reflect the new frontier.
3. **Refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** file for detailed instructions on adding files, formatting content, and submitting a pull request.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To contribute or propose changes, see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document for detailed guidelines on making updates to the taxonomy, schema, or guidelines.

## 📜 License
